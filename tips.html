                        <h3>Water Conservation During Dry Seasons</h3>
                        <p class="author">By Ntate Mafa Khiba, Leribe District</p>
                        <div class="tip-content">
                            <p>After 25 years of farming in Lesotho's challenging climate, I've learned that water conservation can make the difference between a good harvest and crop failure. Here are my proven techniques:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Install simple drip irrigation using plastic bottles with small holes</li>
                                <li>Mulch around plants with grass or crop residue to retain soil moisture</li>
                                <li>Plant drought-resistant varieties like sorghum and millet as backup crops</li>
                                <li>Create small water catchment areas using stones and soil barriers</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These methods have helped me maintain 60% of normal yields even during severe droughts.</p>

                        <div class="tip-content">
                            <p>Running a small agricultural business requires careful financial planning. Here's how I built a safety net that helped me survive three difficult seasons:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Save 15% of every good harvest sale before spending on anything else</li>
                                <li>Keep savings in different forms: cash, stored grain, and livestock</li>
                                <li>Join or form a community savings group (letšema) for mutual support</li>
                                <li>Plan major purchases for immediately after harvest when prices are best</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This approach allowed me to expand my vegetable garden and purchase a water tank during my most profitable year.</p>

                            <p>Chemical pesticides are expensive and can be harmful. These natural methods have protected my crops for over 15 years:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Plant marigolds and mint around vegetables to repel insects</li>
                                <li>Use soap and water spray for aphids and soft-bodied pests</li>
                                <li>Encourage beneficial insects by maintaining wild plants at field edges</li>
                                <li>Rotate crops annually to break pest breeding cycles</li>
                                <li>Hand-pick larger pests during early morning inspections</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These methods cost almost nothing but require consistent attention – the key to successful farming.</p>

                                <li>Compost all organic waste including kitchen scraps and animal manure</li>
                                <li>Plant legumes (beans, peas) to naturally add nitrogen to soil</li>
