                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <div class="story-content">
                    <p>Lesotho Hub began in 2018 as a small initiative by three agricultural graduates who witnessed the challenges facing rural farming communities in Lesotho. What started as a weekend project to distribute seeds to local farmers has grown into a comprehensive agricultural support network serving over 50 communities across the country.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our founders, Thabo Mokoena, Mpho Rakuoane, and Lineo Thabane, combined their expertise in agricultural science, business management, and community development to create sustainable solutions for food security and economic empowerment. They recognized that providing quality seeds and tools was only part of the solution â€“ farmers also needed access to knowledge, markets, and ongoing support.</p>
                    
                    <p>Through partnerships with international development organizations and local cooperatives, Lesotho Hub has established distribution centers in key agricultural regions, providing farmers with access to high-quality inputs, training programs, and market linkages. Our approach focuses on building local capacity while maintaining strong community connections.</p>
                    
                    <p>Today, we continue to expand our impact by developing innovative programs that address the evolving needs of agricultural communities, from climate-resistant crop varieties to digital marketing platforms that connect farmers directly with consumers in urban areas.</p>
